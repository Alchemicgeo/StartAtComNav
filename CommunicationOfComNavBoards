The communication logic of ComNav GNSS Board is a little similar like Novatel OEM Board, 
 the "commands communication" is sperated with "rtcm comminucation". 
 Somtimes they will call them "setup mode" and "diff mode"

The board default mode is "setup mode", so in this case, you can easily send and read any information as you want, 
 for instance, "log version", "log sysconfig", or output the position like "log gpgga ontime 1" and so on.
 But, until now, actually you cannot get RTK positioning still, to make RTK you need satisfy two requirements,
 firstly, the board need get the rtcm corrections, please notice, it will support "rtcm2.3", "rtcm3.0", "rtcm3.1", 3.2, even 3.3, but it cannot support Trimble CMR, or CMR+ very well.

Anyway, let's continue, so simply saying, if you want to get rtk, reach gpgga status as 4 and 5, you must transfer the corrections to one serial port, for example COM1 (actually COM1, COM2, COM3 all support),
 and then set this port as "diff mode", command is "interfacemode COM1 auto auto on", and after that 5-10secs, you should see the status changing.

You need also considered, when after you set "diff mode", normal commands cannot be recognized in this port, 
 so it means, if you only use one port for outputting, corrections commmunicating (of course it can work in one port),
 you need send "interfacemode saveconfig" but not "saveconfig" to save all configures to the memory.

I forget to say, normally, after you send commands, you need send "saveconfig", unless you want to send commands everytime re-powering.
